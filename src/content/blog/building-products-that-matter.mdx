# Building Products That Matter

In today's saturated digital landscape, it's easy to get caught up in building features rather than solving real problems. As product engineers, we have a responsibility to create solutions that genuinely improve people's lives.

## The Problem with Feature-Driven Development

Too often, I see teams falling into the trap of feature-driven development. They build because they can, not because they should. This leads to bloated products that confuse users and dilute the core value proposition.

### What Makes a Product Matter?

A product matters when it:

1. **Solves a real problem** - Not a problem you think exists, but one that actually does
2. **Improves the user's life** - Makes something easier, faster, or more enjoyable
3. **Is sustainable** - Can be maintained and improved over time
4. **Creates genuine value** - For both users and the business

## The User-Centered Approach

When building LeetProduct, I started with a simple observation: Product Managers needed a structured way to practice their craft, similar to how engineers use LeetCode. This wasn't about building another learning platform - it was about addressing a specific gap in PM skill development.

### Key Principles I Follow

**Start with empathy.** Understand your users' pain points before you write a single line of code. Spend time with them, observe their workflows, and listen to their frustrations.

**Validate early and often.** Build the smallest possible version that tests your core hypothesis. Get it in front of users as quickly as possible.

**Measure what matters.** Focus on metrics that reflect real user value, not vanity metrics that make you feel good.

## The Technical Side

From a technical perspective, building products that matter means:

- **Choosing the right tools** for the job, not the newest ones
- **Prioritizing performance** and reliability over flashy features
- **Building for scale** from day one, but not over-engineering
- **Maintaining clean, readable code** that your future self will thank you for

## Conclusion

Building products that matter isn't just about technical excellence - it's about understanding people, solving real problems, and creating lasting value. It's harder than building features, but infinitely more rewarding.

The next time you're planning a feature, ask yourself: "Does this matter? Will this genuinely improve someone's life?" If the answer isn't a clear yes, it might be time to reconsider.
