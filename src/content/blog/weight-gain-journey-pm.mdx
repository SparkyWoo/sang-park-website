In this post, I want to discuss my weight gain journey. I learned a lot from the experience and I thought it'd be useful to share. It generally entails how I was able to healthily gain 35 pounds in 3 months. 

Note that before I started this process, I thought I was one of those people who "just can't gain weight" - a mindset that was completely wrong.

## The Challenge

As someone working in product management, I was spending long hours at the office, often skipping meals or eating irregularly. I was significantly underweight and wanted to build a healthier physique.

## Applying PM Principles to Fitness

### 1. Set Clear Goals and Metrics
- **Target**: Gain 35 pounds in 3 months
- **Daily caloric surplus**: 1000+ calories above maintenance
- **Protein target**: 1g per pound of target body weight
- **Workout frequency**: 4-5 times per week

### 2. Research and Planning
Just like launching a product, I researched extensively:
- Calculated my Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)
- Planned meal timing and composition
- Designed a progressive workout routine
- Tracked everything meticulously

### 3. Execution and Iteration
- **Week 1-2**: Establishing baseline habits
- **Week 3-6**: Optimizing meal timing and portions
- **Week 7-12**: Fine-tuning based on progress data

## The Strategy

### Nutrition Plan
- **Breakfast**: Oatmeal with banana, nuts, and protein powder
- **Mid-morning**: Protein shake with whole milk
- **Lunch**: Large portions with complex carbs and lean protein
- **Pre-workout**: Banana and coffee
- **Post-workout**: Protein shake with simple carbs
- **Dinner**: Balanced meal with vegetables, protein, and carbs
- **Before bed**: Casein protein or Greek yogurt

### Workout Routine
Focused on compound movements:
- Squats
- Deadlifts
- Bench press
- Overhead press
- Pull-ups/Rows

### Tracking and Analytics
Like any good PM, I tracked everything:
- Daily weight measurements
- Caloric intake
- Workout performance
- Sleep quality
- Energy levels

## Results and Learnings

### The Numbers
- **Starting weight**: 145 lbs
- **Ending weight**: 180 lbs
- **Timeline**: 12 weeks
- **Body fat**: Remained relatively stable

### Key Insights

#### 1. Consistency Beats Perfection
Missing a meal here and there didn't derail progress as long as I was consistent overall.

#### 2. Progressive Overload Works
Gradually increasing weights and volume led to steady strength gains.

#### 3. Sleep is Crucial
Recovery and growth happen during sleep. 7-8 hours was non-negotiable.

#### 4. Mindset Shift
Changing from "I can't gain weight" to "I haven't been eating enough" was transformational.

## Applying This to Product Work

This experience taught me valuable lessons applicable to product management:

### Data-Driven Decisions
Regular measurement and adjustment based on data, not feelings.

### Long-term Thinking
Building sustainable habits rather than looking for quick fixes.

### User Research
Understanding the "why" behind behaviors (in this case, my eating patterns).

### Iteration Cycles
Regular review and optimization of the approach.

## Conclusion

The biggest lesson was that most "impossible" challenges are really just problems that haven't been approached systematically. By applying the same rigor I use in product management to fitness, I achieved results I previously thought were impossible.

Whether you're building products or building muscle, the fundamentals remain the same: set clear goals, measure progress, and iterate based on data.
