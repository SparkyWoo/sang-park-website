## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Checklist

### Dependencies to Add
- [ ] `@studio-freight/lenis` - Smooth scrolling
- [ ] `framer-motion` (already installed) - Enhanced animations
- [ ] Custom cursor utilities

### Components to Enhance
- [ ] Hero.tsx - Staggered text animations
- [ ] Projects.tsx - Enhanced hover states
- [ ] Navigation.tsx - Improved animations
- [ ] Layout - Smooth scroll integration
- [ ] Cursor.tsx - New magnetic cursor component

### Files to Modify
- [ ] `globals.css` - New utility classes and cursor styles
- [ ] `layout.tsx` - Lenis integration
- [ ] `tailwind.config.ts` - Custom animations and utilities

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Specifications

### Animation Timing
- **Hover transitions:** 300ms ease-out
- **Text reveals:** 100ms stagger delay
- **Cursor movement:** 150ms ease-out
- **Scroll smoothness:** 1.2 lerp factor

### Visual Effects
- **Tilt angle:** Maximum 15 degrees
- **Hover scale:** 1.02x for cards
- **Shadow blur:** 20px on hover
- **Cursor size:** 40px default, 60px on hover

### Color Enhancements
- **Accent color:** `#3B82F6` (blue-500) for highlights
- **Glow effects:** `rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.3)`
- **Shadow colors:** `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)`

## ðŸ”§ Performance Considerations
- Use `transform` and `opacity` for animations (GPU accelerated)
- Implement `will-change` property strategically
- Debounce cursor movement events
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations
- Lazy load heavy effects on user interaction

## ðŸ“± Mobile Optimizations
- Disable magnetic cursor on touch devices
- Reduce animation complexity on mobile
- Optimize scroll performance for iOS Safari
- Ensure touch targets remain accessible

## ðŸ§ª Testing Requirements
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- [ ] Performance testing (Lighthouse scores)
- [ ] Accessibility testing (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- [ ] Animation performance (60fps target)

## ðŸ“ˆ Success Metrics
- Improved user engagement (time on site)
- Reduced bounce rate
- Positive user feedback
- Maintained Lighthouse performance scores (90+)
- Smooth 60fps animations

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
1. Install required dependencies
2. Implement smooth scrolling foundation
3. Enhance project card hover states
4. Add staggered text animations
5. Implement magnetic cursor
6. Test and optimize performance
7. Prepare for Phase 2 improvements
